# Introducing Code, the programming language

Code is a statically typed, object-oriented, homebrew programming language with a syntax similar to C#. It takes inspiration from various programming languages that I have developed in. The reason I am developing Code is for fun. The main purpose of Code is to make building interactive applications with 2D graphics as easy and fun as possible. If you're interested in the specific design of Code, the design documentation was adapted to markdown and uploaded to GitHub which you can find here: [language_design.md](https://github.com/James-Calvin/Code/blob/master/language_design.md).

# Examples of Code code

I'll add some examples of Code programs here after I have a working compiler and remember to update this file. In the meantime, you can view some examples of Code code here: [examples/](https://github.com/James-Calvin/Code/tree/master/examples)

# Getting started with Code

Again, once I have a working compiler and remember to update this files and have a published version of Code, I will provide instruction on how to get started with Code here.

Well, I guess that's all for now. Thanks for stopping by!
