## Syntax and Semantics

### Basic Syntax

Code uses a syntax similar to C#, with some simplifications to enhance readability and ease of use.

### Data Types

- `Integer`: Represents whole numbers.
- `Float`: Represents floating-point numbers.
- `Boolean`: Represents true/false values.
- `Character`: Represents single characters.
- `String`: Represents sequences of characters.
- `Record`: Represents structured data.
- `Vector`: Represents 2D or 3D vectors.
- `UnitInterval`: Represents numbers in the range [0,1].
- `Color`: Represents colors.

### Variables and Constants

Variables are declared using the `let` keyword. Constants are declared using the `constant` keyword. Variables can be suffixed with `?` to denote the variable is nullable.

```code
let x = 10
constant PI = 3.14159
let y? = null
```

### Control Flow

- **If Statement**: Conditional execution of code blocks.
- **For Loop**: Iterative execution of code blocks.
- **Foreach Loop**: Iterative execution for each element within an iterable.
- **While Loop**: Repeated execution of code blocks based on a condition.
- **Do While Loop**: Executes the block once before checking the condition.
- **Break and Continue**: Control loop execution.
- **Match Statement**: Pattern matching for complex conditions.

```code
if x > 5 {
    // Do something
} else {
    // Do something else
}

for let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1 {
    // Loop body
}

while x < 10 {
    // Loop body
}

do {
    // Loop body
} while x < 10
```

### Functions

Functions are declared using the `function` keyword.

```code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
```

### Classes and Objects

Classes support encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

```code
class Person {
    public string name
    public integer age

    constructor(string name, integer age) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }

    public function greet() {
        println("Hello, my name is " + self.name)
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    public integer grade

    constructor(string name, integer age, integer grade) {
        super(name, age)
        self.grade = grade
    }
}
```

### Operators

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Assignment: `=`
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Compound Assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
- Unary Negation: `-`

### Comments

- Single-line comments: `//` or `#`
- Multi-line comments: `/* ... */`
- Markdown comments: `/~~ ... ~~`

```code
// This is a single-line comment
# This is another single-line comment

/*
This is a
multi-line comment
*/

/~~
This is a markdown comment
~~/
```

### Literals

- **Integer**: A sequence of digits, with optional negative sign.
  - Examples: `42`, `-1`, `0`
- **Float**: A sequence of digits with a decimal point, with optional negative sign.
  - Examples: `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`
- **Boolean**: `true` or `false`
- **Character**: A single character enclosed in single quotes.
  - Examples: `'a'`, `'1'`, `'\n'`
- **String**: A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
  - Examples: `"Hello, World!"`, `"123"`, `"This is a string"`

## Standard Library

### Overview

The standard library provides a comprehensive set of functions and data structures to support common programming tasks.

### Console

Functions for input and output.

```code
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!")
Console.ReadLine()
```

### Math

Common mathematical functions.

```code
let result = Math.sqrt(16)
let angle = Math.PI / 2
```

### Collections

Data structures like lists and dictionaries.

```code
let list = List()
list.add(1)
list.add(2)
list.remove(1)
```

### Utilities

Helper functions and utilities.

```code
let now = DateTime.now()
let guid = Guid.new()
```

## Language Implementation

### Lexer

The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input source code. It converts a stream of characters into a stream of tokens.

### Parser

The parser converts the stream of tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST), representing the hierarchical structure of the source code.

### AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

The AST represents the syntactic structure of the source code. Each node in the tree corresponds to a construct occurring in the source code.

### Interpreter/Compiler

The interpreter or compiler traverses the AST to execute the program or generate machine code.

### Error Handling

Strategies for handling different types of errors:

- **Lexical Errors**: Detected during tokenization.
- **Syntax Errors**: Detected during parsing.
- **Runtime Errors**: Detected during execution.

## Use Cases

- **2D Game Development**: Rapidly prototype and develop 2D games.
- **Educational Projects**: Teach programming concepts with a simple and readable syntax.
- **Interactive Applications**: Create interactive applications with robust input/output support.
